## Description

Originally released as part of AppSecCali 2015 Talk
["Marshalling Pickles: how deserializing objects will ruin your day"](
        https://frohoff.github.io/appseccali-marshalling-pickles/)
with gadget chains for Apache Commons Collections (3.x and 4.x), Spring Beans/Core (4.x), and Groovy (2.3.x).
Later updated to include additional gadget chains for
[JRE <= 1.7u21](https://gist.github.com/frohoff/24af7913611f8406eaf3) and several other libraries.

__ysoserial__ is a collection of utilities and property-oriented programming "gadget chains" discovered in common java
libraries that can, under the right conditions, exploit Java applications performing __unsafe deserialization__ of
objects. The main driver program takes a user-specified command and wraps it in the user-specified gadget chain, then
serializes these objects to stdout. When an application with the required gadgets on the classpath unsafely deserializes
this data, the chain will automatically be invoked and cause the command to be executed on the application host.

It should be noted that the vulnerability lies in the application performing unsafe deserialization and NOT in having
gadgets on the classpath.
